1. create new Branch from existing branch(main in this case)
	git checkout -b newBranchName existingBranchName
	
2. Once done with work, run following commands in the newBranchName (add command to stage the changes, commit command to commit changes)
	git add .
	git commit -m "Your message"
	
3. Once committed, switch the branch to main(or whichever branch you want to merge changes into) branch
	git checkout main
	
4. Pull the latest changes in the main branch if any
	git pull origin main
	
5. git checkout to your branch again and merge the changes from main to your newBranchName
	git checkout newBranchName
	git merge main
	
6. Check for conflicts if any, 
	if conflicts, solve them. Once resolved, stage and commit and push
		git add .
		git commit -m "Conflicts resolved"
		git push origin newBranchName
	
	if no conflicts, push the final changes
		git push origin newBranchName
	
7. Checkout again to main branch, merge the changes from your branch to main
	git checkout main
	git pull
	git merge newBranchName
	git push origin main
